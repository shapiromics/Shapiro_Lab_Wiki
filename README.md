# Shapiro_Lab_Wiki

This repo was made simply for the **[wiki website](https://github.com/shapiromics/Shapiro_Lab_Wiki/wiki)** functionality, which lab members can use for sharing internal documentations and notes. Please note that this repo and wiki are open to the public though - so **do not post anything that could be a privacy or security risk**.

New Shapiro Lab members should be added as collaborators on this repo, so that they can read the wiki and make new or edit existing wiki pages.
